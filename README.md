# Laravel Tutorial

Creating a Laravel application involves a few fundamental steps. Here's a quick guide to get you started:

1. **System Requirements**: Make sure your system meets Laravel's requirements. You will need PHP, Composer, and a suitable web server like Apache or Nginx.

2. **Install Composer**: Composer is a dependency manager for PHP. Download and install it from [getcomposer.org](https://getcomposer.org/).

3. **Create a New Laravel Project**:
   Use Composer to create a new Laravel project. Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
   ```
   composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel yourProjectName
   ```
   Replace `yourProjectName` with whatever you wish to name your project.

4. **Serve the Application**:
   Laravel includes a built-in development server. You can start it by running:
   ```
   php artisan serve
   ```
   This command will start a development server at `http://localhost:8000`. Open this URL in your web browser to see your new Laravel application.

5. **Database Configuration**:
   Edit the `.env` file in your project root to configure your database settings. You’ll need to provide details like the database connection, username, password, etc.

6. **Run Migrations**:
   Laravel uses migrations to manage your database schema. To create the database structure, run:
   ```
   php artisan migrate
   ```
   This will set up your database tables according to the migrations found in the `database/migrations` directory.

7. **Explore Routes and Controllers**:
   Start adding routes to your application by editing the `routes/web.php` file. For handling logic, you can generate controllers using:
   ```
   php artisan make:controller MyController
   ```
   Replace `MyController` with the name of your controller.

8. **Views**:
   Create views using Blade, Laravel’s templating engine. Views are stored in the `resources/views` folder. You can return these views from your controllers or routes.

9. **Testing and Development**:
   Continue developing your application by adding more routes, controllers, views, and models as needed. Test your application thoroughly.

10. **Deployment**:
    When you're ready to go live, you can deploy your Laravel application to a web server. This typically involves transferring your files to a server, configuring your environment, and setting up a web server and database.

Laravel has extensive documentation, which is an excellent resource as you build more complex applications. You can find it at [Laravel's official website](https://laravel.com/docs).
